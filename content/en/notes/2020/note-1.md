Journaling is the practice of regularly writing down thoughts, feelings, and experiences to reflect on life and gain clarity. It offers a private space to process emotions, track growth, and set intentions. Whether done daily or occasionally, journaling encourages mindfulness and self-awareness. Over time, it becomes a personal archive of your inner journey.
