When you take notes, you're not just passively receiving information — you're actively interacting with it. This process forces you to listen carefully, identify key concepts, rephrase ideas in your own words, and decide what’s important. By doing so, you're engaging in active learning, which significantly enhances comprehension and long-term memory. This engagement also helps you stay mentally present, ask better questions, and participate more meaningfully in discussions, making the learning experience much more effective and personal.
